## Development of sync/async HTTP web services and their comparison.

## Prerequisites

We will perform load testing of our HTTP services, therefore we need to install some tools for that.
You can choose between:

- [Apache Benchmark](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/ab.html)

- Hey ([Installation instructions](https://github.com/rakyll/hey?tab=readme-ov-file#installation))

## Setup

1. Setup your virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```shell
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
